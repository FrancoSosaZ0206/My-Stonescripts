//Pirate Hats
//by: michael.g.g.
//ver 1.0

//This script is set to use a more detailed tricorn pirate hat when in big head mode and a bicorn hat with regular head. 
//Colors for both hats and accessories can be modified by changing their variables below.
//You can use names of colors such as #blue and #red but specific colors and shades will need to use a hex format.

//This cosmetic was also designed to be compatible with the Skully hat. 
//Import this *after* the Skully hat to get a skeleton pirate look.

var bicornColor
var tricornColor
var eyePatchColor
var jollyRogerColor

//modify the values here to change colors-----
bicornColor = #999999
tricornColor = #b29670
jollyRogerColor = #white
eyePatchColor = #777777
